	name="Gold Decay"
	description="A standalone version of the Gold Decay function from the now-defunct Goki's Things

Not enough time to pick up those gold nuggets? Gold is Forever leaves so many nuggets around that your system chokes on the physics calculations? Look no further, the best of both worlds is here!

Gold decay replaces gold nuggets with their value in gold dust when they expire, letting you pick up the gold at your leisure without melting your CPU.

This mod replaces the vanilla Gold is Forever perk with the Gold Decay perk in the perk pool. There is an option to receive the perk on spawn."
