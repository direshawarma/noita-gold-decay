# noita-gold-decay

A standalone version of the Gold Decay function from the now-defunct Goki's Things

Gold decay causes gold nuggets that despawn to drop their value in gold dust. It's like Gold is Forever, but the physics engine doesn't go nuts if you have too many uncollected nuggets around.

# Installation

You can install this mod from the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2974676645)

# Settings

### Decay Mode

* Perk (default) - Replaces Gold is Forever in the perk pool with Gold Decay
* Replace Gold is Forever - Removes Gold is Forever from the perk pool and gives the player the Gold Decay perk upon spawn
* Off - Soft-disables the mod

### Dust Percentage

This controls what percentage of the original nugget will be converted to gold.
